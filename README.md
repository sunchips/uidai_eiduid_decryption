EID-UID Decryption Utility
==========================

This application runs on Java 7 and it requires JCE ((http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html) to be installed for decrytping files that are more strongly encrypted.

Run this like you would run any .jar file.

For example: `java -Xms1024m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar DecryptionUtility.jar`
